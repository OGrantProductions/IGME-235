        <p id="bio"> I am a 5th year Game Design and Development major from Atlanta, GA. I like to spend my free time
            watching anime and YouTube, playing video games, and hanging out with friends. I've been a member of
            Velocity: RIT's Urban Dance Crew since my first year at RIT and I am currently the Vice President of the
            team. I also play intramural volleyball.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope that I can use what I learn in this class, as well the rest of the classes I take at RIT, to broaden
            the scope of my abilities and make me a more favorable candidate in the job market. After graduating, I hope
            that I can go straight into a game development job, or at the very least stay in the software development
            sphere. Eventually, I would like to work either as an independent developer of my own games, or I'd want
            to have my own Indie Game studio.
