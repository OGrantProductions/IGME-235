    <h1>Project 3 Proposal</h1>
    <h2 id="gameTitle">Minesweeper</h2>
    <h2>High Concept</h2>
    <p>This game is Minesweeper but the player can customize the board size and the number of bombs on the board.</p>
    <h2>Genre/Platform/Story/Aesthetics</h2>
    <p>Minesweeper is a strategy, puzzle game. This version will be a desktop web game with a more modern look and nicer
        color palette than the original Minesweeper. This game will have as much story as the original minesweeper,
        which is to say, none at all.</p>
    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>In the setup of the game, the player will be able to select how many rows and columns they want for their board,
        as well as how many bombs will be on the board. During gameplay, everything will be done using the mouse. The
        player will left-click to reveal a tile and right-click to flag a tile as a mine. They will only have as many
        flags as there are bombs on the board. The game ends when the player either left-clicks a mine, or properly
        reveals all of the tiles on the board./p>

    <h2>Other</h2>
    <p> For this project, I'll be using the Pixel Artist and Game of Life extra credits as a basis. If I were to come
        back and work on this game after this semester, I would like to add the ability to make your own boards where
        you can place bombs in specific spots. I would also want the player to be able to save these boards, as well as
        be able to upload custom boards to play, or possible have boards be saved to a key/seed.</p>
