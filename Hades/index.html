        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p> Hades is a rogue-like dungeon crawler in which you defy the god of death as you hack and slash your way out
            of the Underworld of Greek myth.
            <br>
            The player takes the role of Zagreus, the prince of the Underworld, who is trying to escape the realm to get
            away from his dispassionate father, Hades, and reach Mount Olympus. His quest is supported by the other
            Olympians, who grant him gifts to help fight through the beings that protect the exit from the Underworld.
        </p>

        <h1>Review</h1>
        <blockquote>Hades is a sublime mix of satisfyingly gritty and flexible combat, a wonderfully vibrant art style
            and genuinely fun and engaging narrative. Supergiant Games has an excellent track record thus far but this
            really does feel its finest hour, a rip-roaring rampage through the underworld that's arrived here on Switch
            in a port that's nigh-on perfect. Even if you're yet to be swayed by the admittedly repetitive ebb and flow
            of the roguelike genre, we passionately urge you to at least give this one a try; for fans of the genre or
            anyone even remotely interested, this is one heavenly vision of hell that we highly recommend you sacrifice
            yourself to. - <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hades">Nintendo Life Hades
