    <h2>Initial Proposal</h2>
    <p>
        I plan on creating a Pokemon guessing game, similar to Wordle.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Purpose: To give people a chance to test their Pokemon knowledge in a simple guessing game.</li>
        <li>Audience: People that have played multiple Pokemon games and feel they have a pretty good knowledge of
            different
            Pokemon.</li>
        <li>Main Functionality: The Web App will retrieve info about a random pokemon for the user to guess, assigned to
            "pokemonToGuess", and then, after receiving the info for the user's guess, check each guess from the user
            against the "pokemonToGuess", comparing their typing, generation, height, and weight. This will happen for
            each guess until the user runs out of tries or guesses the correct Pokemon.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I plan on using the RESTful Pok√©mon API. - <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a>

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>

    <h3>Who's That Pokemon? Mockup</h3>

    <h3>Grade</h3>
    <p>I believe this is an A-level project because I went beyond making a simple search application. I was able to
        create an interactive experience similar to the game Wordle, but with Pokemon. I created a very pleasing layout
        for the user, and I also added quality of life features to make things easier for the player such as choosing
        which generation of pokemon the user wants to guess from and addding a suggestions dropdown where the user
        guesses that changes based on the generation they picked beforehand.</p>

    <h3>Changes</h3>
    <p>From the initial mockup, I only made a few changes. I removed the generation column, opting to allow the user to
        pick the generation they want to guess from beforehand. I also did not add in the ability to deactivate certain
        columns of info for more of a challenge but I may consider adding that feature in the future.
