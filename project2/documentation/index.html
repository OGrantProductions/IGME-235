    <h2>Initial Proposal</h2>
    <p>
        I plan on creating a Pokemon guessing game, similar to Wordle.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Purpose: To give people a chance to test their Pokemon knowledge in a simple guessing game.</li>
        <li>Audience: People that have played multiple Pokemon games and feel they have a pretty good knowledge of
            different
            Pokemon.</li>
        <li>Main Functionality: The Web App will retrieve info about a random pokemon for the user to guess, assigned to
            "pokemonToGuess", and then, after receiving the info for the user's guess, check each guess from the user
            against the "pokemonToGuess", comparing their typing, generation, height, and weight. This will happen for
            each guess until the user runs out of tries or guesses the correct Pokemon.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I plan on using the RESTful Pok√©mon API. - <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">https://pokeapi.co/</a>
